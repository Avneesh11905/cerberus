Port: Shared Email Client

Defines the generic interface for dispatching a pre-rendered email.
Infrastructure adapters (Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.) implement this port.
Domain-specific email services (e.g. AuthEmailService) depend on this port
so that swapping the email provider only requires changing one file in shared/adapters.
